Welcome to my LeetCode Top Interview 150 repository! 🚀


☘️ This repository contains my solutions to the LeetCode Top Interview 150 coding problems. 

☘️ I've tackled a variety of algorithmic challenges that cover essential data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques for coding interviews.

## 📂 **File Structure:**

✅ Each file is named according to the problem number for easy navigation (e.g Prob1.java which stands for problem no. 1: two sum problem).

✅ I've included detailed comments in each solution to explain the thought process, logic and algorithm used. 

✅ This should help in understanding the approach and implementing solutions more quickly and easily!

## 🔍 **How to Search for Solutions:**

📌 You can search by problem number to find the solution you're looking for. 

📌Files are stored in dictionary order.
